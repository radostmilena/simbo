You can stop the animation at any point using the blue 'on/off' button on the top right, but if you run it again, it will then restart form the beginning. You can also decrease or increase the speed of the animation by setting <i>time_per_step</i> to a higher or lower value. It is set to 3000 now, so you can really see the changes in the energy levels of the molecules as they exchange energy in the first graph and how that translates to the distribution of energy levels in the second graph. In later tasks however, you may want to decrease <i>time_per_step</i> again, as simulations of a lot of molecules will take longer to be animated. By default, the animation will only display the first 50 steps of the simulation, but if you want to follow it for longer, you can increase the value of <i>len_tot</i> to anything up to $200*N$. However, when working on the tasks you will not have to follow the animation all the way through to get the final distribution, as most tasks will have a function that automatically saves a graph of the final step.</p>"
