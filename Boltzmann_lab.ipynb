By default, there will be $20*N$ equilibration steps ($N$ being the number of molecules) before it starts to store the data. This is because the intial state is generated randomly, so very often it will result in a microstate with very low probability. Since we want to look at the system in equilibrium, we need to let it perfrom a couple of energy exchanges first. You can set the number of steps that are used for data collection after the equilibration yourself by setting <i>nstot</i> to different values; here it is set to $200*N$, but you may want to change it later. </p>"

    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;  line-height: 1.6;\">You may see an asterisk (*) appearing in  the square brackets next to the cell,, thaht simply means it is still running the code. Once a number appears,  the simualtion will be done and all the data generated by it is stored in your RAM. You can look at it by running the next cell, which will show you three graphs and a couple of values. The first graph on the top left is an animation of the energy levels, it shows which molecule occupies which energy level at a certain time step. Note that the animation will not start at step 0 because of the equilibration. The second graph on the top right is an animation of the distribution of levels, i.e. it shows how many molecules are in a certain energy level at a certain time step. As with the first graph, it will only start after equilibration. The third graph on the bottom left is an animation of the average distribution of levels, so it shows how many molecules have been in this energy level on average so far. For this, the simulation will accumulate the data of the previous graph and average it over time and the number of accumulated steps is counted here (which is exactly the current step minus the number of equilibration steps). Note that this distribution shows the average number of molecules in the given state. In order to get the probability distribution over the energy levels, one must divide this function by the number of molecules, $N$.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;  line-height: 1.6;\">The animation will also display some thermodynamic data on the bottom right. Here, you can choose if you want this data to be in default or in reduced units by setting <i>units</i> to either 'default' or 'reduced' (don't forget the quotation marks here or it will not work). Reduced units will have the energy set to units of $h c \\tilde\\nu$, while the entropy is in units of $k_B$ per molecule and temperature in units of $h c \\tilde\\nu / k_B$ and default units will have the energies in $\\mathrm{J}$, entropy in $\\mathrm{ J / K}$ and temperature in $\\mathrm{K}$. You can also decrease the speed of the animation by setting <i>time_per_step</i> to a higher value. It is set to 2000 now, so you can really see the changes in the energy levels of the molecules as they exchange energy in the first graph and how that translates to the distribution of energy levels in the second graph. In later tasks however, you may want to decrease <i>time_per_step</i> again, as simulations of a lot of molecules will take longer to be animated (remember, each simulation runs for $200*N$ steps).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;  line-height: 1.6;\">Notes: The graphs may take a second or two to start being updated and another second to snap to the surrounding frame, so just have a little patience here. The animation is also displayed in interactive mode, which means you can stop it at any time using the blue off button on the top right or take screenshots of the current step by pressing the save icon on the bottom right. The latter will take you to a separate tab where you can download the image as a PNG. Note that the animation will keep running while you are away from the notebook tab, so make sure to adjust the <i>time_per_step</i> accordingly to leave enough time for you to come back to it or stop the animation and rerun it by executing the cell again after you have saved your picture. </p>"

Execute the cell and move on to <i>Generating the intial state</i>. Now, instead of using the automatic generation of levels, generate a state in which both molecules are in the first excited state, i.e. fill in [1, 1] for the parameter <i>levels</i>. Run the simulation as before and save a picture of the resulting distributions (you can decrease <i>time_per_step</i> slightly to speed up the animation). During the animation, observe how the statistical weight changes and try to write down all possible microstates and corresponding configurations. Deduce the probability of each configuration, and determine the average number of molecules in each state from that.</p>\n",

In each case, plot the probability distribution $\\rho_n$ together with the ideal Boltzmann distribution and the linear fit of the logarithmic distribution (Section <i>The Boltzmann distribution</i>).
