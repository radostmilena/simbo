    "Now, all the data generated by the simulation is stored in your RAM and you can look at it by running the next cell. It will show you three graphs and a couple of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first graph on the top left is an animation of the energy levels, so it shows which molecule occupies which energy level at a certain time step. Note that the animation will start at a higher number, because of the equilibration. The second graph on the top right is an animation of the distribution of levels, i.e. it shows how many molecules are in a certain energy level at a certain time step. As with the first graph, it will only start after equilibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third graph on the bottom left is an animation of the average distribution of levels, so it shows how many molecules have been in this energy level on average so far. For this, the simulation will accumulate the data of the previous graph and average it over time, therefore the number of accumulated steps is counted here (which is exactly the current step minus the number of equilibration steps). Note that this distribution shows the average number of molecules in the given state.  In order to get the probability distribution over the energy levels, one must divide this function by the number of molecules, $N$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The animation will also display some thermodynamic data on the bottom right. Here, you can choose if you want this data to be in default (energies/entropies in kJ/mol, temperature in K) or in reduced units by setting <i>units</i> to either 'default' or 'reduced' (don't forget the quotation marks here or it will not work). You can also decrease the speed of the animation by setting <i>time_per_step</i> to a higher value. It is set to 2000 now, so you can really see the changes in the energy levels of the molecules as they exchange energy in the first graph and how that translates to the distribution of energy levels in the second graph. In later tasks however, you may want to decrease <i>time_per_step</i> again, as simulations of a lot of molecules will take longer to be animated (remember, each simulation runs for $20*N$ steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: The graphs may take a second or two to start being updated and another second to snap to the surrounding frame, so just have a little patience here. The animation is moreover displayed in interactive mode, which means you can stop it at any time using the blue off button on the top right or take screenshots of the current step by pressing the save icon on the bottom right. The latter will take you to a separate tab where you can download the image as a PNG. Note that the animation will keep running while you are away from the notebook tab, so make sure to adjust the <i>time_per_step</i> accordingly to leave enough time for you to come back to it.)"

    "Go back to the cell below the heading <i>Initial input</i> and set the number of molecules to 2. Execute the cell and move on to <i>Generating the intial state</i>. Now, instead of using the automatic generation of levels, generate a state in which both molecules are in the first excited state, i.e. fill in [1, 1] for the parameter <i>levels</i>. Run the simulation as before and save a picture of the resulting distributions (you can decrease <i>time_per_step</i> slightly to speed up the animation). During the animation, observe how the statistical weight changes and afterwards, write down all possible microstates and corresponding configurations. Deduce the probability of each configuration, and determine average number of molecules in each state from that.\n",

    "   Run the same simulation, but with both molecules in a higher state, eg. levels = [5, 5]. Observe the statistical weight and at the end, take a picture of the final distribution. Try the same setup several times and compare the outcome (make sure to save a picture). Again, write down all possible microstates and corresponding configurations and deduce the probability of each configuration and average number of molecules. What do you observe?\n",

Note that the larger number of molecules is set, the longer simulations is needed to get reliable average distribution (a  reasonable value of number of steps may be 200*$N$). In each case, plot the final distribution over the energy levels in a logarithmic scale together with the \"true\" Boltzmann distribution. Observe how the calculated distribution approaches to the Boltzmann distribution with the growth of $N$. In each case, write down the average energy and calculated temperature.

    "Prepare initial state for $N = 10$ molecules, and put the first molecule in a high energy state (for example, $n_1 = 12$), and other molecules in the ground state (go back to the manual generation of levels and put levels = [12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]). Look at the statistical weight $W$ and the Boltzmann entropy. How do they change? \n",
    "If you don't want to write down everything manually from the animation, you can use this extra function that will print both $W$ and $S$ for a specified interval (only within the accumulated steps, so you can not specify a start or and end that is larger than $40*N$). Again, you can select the units by setting <i>units</i> to 'default' or 'reduced' (remember the quotation marks)."
